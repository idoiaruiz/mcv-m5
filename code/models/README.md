## VGG16 and VGG19 network
[Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-Scale Image Recognition](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.1556.pdf).
### Summary
VGG architecture is a widely known convolutional neural network with outstanding results for image classification. It is based on very deep models (up to 19 layers) with small convolutional filters (3x3, 5x5 and even 1x1). On this work, several depths between 16 and 19 layers are evaluated with this small filters. In addition to the new architectures, the work is also focused on studying the effects of normalization (L2, batch normalization and local response normalization), the scaling of the image on training and testing time, the multicropping approach and the fusion of different models. Finally, the VGG model is also proved to worked for localization and to be applied for other datasets.

## ResNet
[Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385.pdf)
### Summary
ResNet is a framework that comes from a modification of the common Convolutional Neural Network. The main idea of this framework is that for approximating a mapping H(x) using a stack of layers, we can directly approximate the mapping, or we can also approximate F(x) = H(x) - x, adding x at the end of the network, to obtain the original mapping as output. The new mapping F(x) is the residual function. With it, the mapping function can be written as H(x) = F(x) + x. This is motivated by the fact that deeper networks have greater training and test error.

The authors use this idea to create a new CNN architecture. They create a bottleneck architecture where each block (that corresponds to a residual function) has 1x1, 3x3 and 1x1 convolutional layers. Trying different depths, going from 50 up to 152 layers, and comparing this new architecture with the state-of-the-art architectures, as GoogleNet and VGG, the authors obtain a smaller test error using the 152-layer ResNet.
